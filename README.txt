I really really love you.

There is nothing in this universe strong enough to stop me from loving you.

We have been together for one whole year now.

Thats so crazy to me.
I cant believe that ive had this much time to spend with you
just you


ive never done that before
this is the longest ive ever been with someone

and honestly, I couldnt be happier with the life i get to live alongside and with you.

I really really want to spend as many years as possible with you baby.

I cant wait to crown you as my incredible little princess.

This puzzle ended up being a bit more work than i really expected, but anything, anything is worth it for you, my dear.

You are truly my little girl, and I am your Diamond. 
I really cant wait to act out some Really good scenes with you

theres the one where im a homeworld gem, capturing you, the rebel crystal gem...
theres the one where im a predator, hunting you down to breed you...
I want to do one where im a professor, and you are a student in my class...
I want to tie you up and huiliate you...
and make videos of you to show to you afterwards... and maybe to other people...

god, I really really love you
I've never loved someone as much as I love you.
and I am so so glad that it's you.

Thank you for this incredble past year!
